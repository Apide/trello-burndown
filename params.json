{"name":"trello-burndown","body":"Generate a burndown chart from trello cards.\r\n\r\n## How it works\r\n\r\nIf you use [Trello](http://trello.com \"Trello\") to manage your sprint cards, you might want to generate your burndown chart automatically instead of doing it manually.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n* Load cards from Trello based on a sprint-definition\r\n* Export of statistics\r\n* Handling of concurrent sprints\r\n* Hosting via Web Server\r\n\r\n### Preconditions\r\n\r\nAs a precondition you have to encode some information into the card's title. This looks like that:\r\n\r\n\t[p|est-e] title\r\n\r\n**Huh?**\r\n\r\n* **p**: the priority/order of the task (to be \"visible\" if a task is moved to another list)\r\n* **est**: the estimate of the task, defined within the sprint planning\r\n* **e**: the real effort (to reflect this against the estimate)\r\n\r\n### Generate it!\r\n\r\nTo generate it, you have to execute `generate.js` as described below:\r\n\r\n\tnode generate.js -l \"lists\" -d \"included dates\" -r \"count days\" -f \"finish list\"\r\n\r\n* **-l**: [required] A comma separated list of Trello lists (by name) that are set up for the sprint, e.g. _Planned_, _In progress_, _Testing_, _Finished_\r\n* **-d**: [required] A comma separated list of dates in the format YYYY-MM-DD describing the days are part of the sprint\r\n* **-r**: [required] A comma separated list of 0 or 1 (maching the days list) describing if a day is a working day or not (special days are the first - sprint planning - and the last one - deployment/recap)\r\n* **-f**: [required] The name of the list where finished tasks have to be moved to\r\n* **-t**: [optional] Time of your daily standup meeting. If this is defined, values are calculated based on this time, instead of midnight. **Please note** that you have to define the time in [ISO 8601](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601 \"ISO 8601\") format.\r\n* **-n**: [required] Name of the sprint; is used for file generation too\r\n\r\nAn example call:\r\n\r\n\tnode generate.js -l \"Planned, In progress, Testing, Finished\" -d \"2013-02-01, 2013-02-02\" -r \"1,1\" -f \"Finished\"\r\n\r\nExample call with standup meeting:\r\n\r\n\tnode generate.js -l \"Planned, In progress, Testing, Finished\" -d \"2013-02-01, 2013-02-02\" -r \"1,1\" -f \"Finished\" -t \"10:00:00+01:00\"\t\r\n\r\nBased on the given information total estimates, efforts etc. are calculated and exported to subfolder `export` in JSON format. The exported data can be viewed using the included web server.\r\n\r\n## Web server\r\n\r\nTo start the web server use the command\r\n\r\n\tnode run.js\r\n\r\nPer default you can connect to `http://localhost:8008/?sprint=[sprintname]`. Replace `[sprintname]` with the name you used for generation (option `-n`). \r\n\r\n### Supported browsers\r\n\r\nTo view the charts you can use Chrome (Chromium), Firefox, Safari (WebKit), Opera and IE10 (IE9 may work, not tested yet).\r\n\r\n### Sample\r\n\r\nHere is a screenshot of a generated burndown chart (for a very bad sprint):\r\n\r\n![Sample burndown chart](http://i.imgur.com/uZbkr.png \"Sample burndown chart\")\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nYou can install this via `npm`:\r\n\r\n\tnpm install trello-burndown\r\n\r\nIt's recommended to create a daily job that generates the necessary data to be served by the web server.\r\n\r\n### Obtain a Trello token\r\n\r\nFirst, log in to Trello and open [Generate API Keys](https://trello.com/1/appKey/generate \"Generate API Keys\"). You will receive an key to use in the next step.\r\n\r\nSecond, call https://trello.com/1/authorize?key=YOUR_KEY&name=trello-releasenotes&expiration=never&response_type=token to grant access for this application. Be sure to replace `YOUR_KEY` with the key received in the first step.\r\n\r\n> For further information visit: [Getting a Token from a User](https://trello.com/docs/gettingstarted/index.html#getting-a-token-from-a-user \"Getting a Token from a User\")\r\n\r\nStore the key from the first action in setting `applicationKey` of `settings.json` and the token received from the second step in `userToken`. To connect to the board of your choice, copy the board id from your web browser.\r\n\r\nThere are some settings you can set up in `settings.json`:\r\n\r\n\tapplicationKey\tInsert your obtained application key from Trello to get access to it\r\n\tuserToken\tDefine your user token you will receive when obtaining an application key\r\n\tboardId\t\tDefine the id of the board you want to search for release notes\r\n\tport \t\tThe port the web server is listening, default is 8008\r\n\r\n## Planned features\r\n\r\n* Use templating support for HTML generation\r\n* Generate charts on the fly and serve it via HTTP server\r\n* Configure via web page","note":"Don't delete this file!
